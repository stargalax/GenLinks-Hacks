## 🚀 Setup (takes about 5 minutes)

### Step 1 — Install Node.js
If you don't have it: https://nodejs.org → download the **LTS** version and install it.

### Step 2 — Clone / download this folder
Put the `electron-app` folder somewhere on your computer.

### Step 3 — Install dependencies
Open a terminal inside the `electron-app` folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4 — Add your Groq API key
Open `index.html` and find this line near the top of the `<script>` tag:
```js
const GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE";
```
Replace `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Groq key from https://console.groq.com

### Step 5 — Run it!
```bash
npm start
```

A small floating window will appear in the top-right corner of your screen. 🎉
